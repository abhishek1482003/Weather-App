# Weather App 🌤️

Welcome to my **Weather App** project! This is part of my mini-project series where I build small, interactive applications to practice and showcase my skills in web development. This app fetches real-time weather data for any city or your current location using the **OpenWeatherMap API**.

## 📝 What I Learned

- **API Integration**: Fetching and displaying real-time data from an external API.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Using `async/await` for API calls.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically updating the UI based on user input.
- **Error Handling**: Displaying user-friendly messages for invalid inputs or API errors.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the app works well on all screen sizes.
